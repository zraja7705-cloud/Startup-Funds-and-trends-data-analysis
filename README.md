# Startup-Funds-and-trends-data-analysis
This project looks at startup funding data to find patterns and trends. Using RapidMiner, we clean and organize the data, calculate total funding over time, see which countries or industries get the most investment, and make charts to show these trends. It helps understand how startup funding changes over the years and which startups get more money.
How it works:
Import the funding data (CSV or Excel) into RapidMiner.
Clean and prepare the data (remove missing values, fix formats).
Group and summarize the data (by year, country, or funding amount).
Make charts and tables to show trends and patterns.
Save the results and share them in the GitHub repository.
